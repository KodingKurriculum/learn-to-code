# Learn to Code

## What does it mean to code?
When a software developer writes code, they are creating instructions for the computer to perform tasks like do math, display a webpage, or store information.  Developers use programming languages like Python or Java to write these instructions in a file.  When they run the program, a special language-specific program on the computer translates those lines of Python or Java code into something the computer understands.

## Why should I learn?
Learning to code is valuable and fun!
* Its valuable because you learn a new skill that can have a dramatic influence on the way that you solve problems.
* Its fun because writing code can be challenging and rewarding. You feel a sense of accomplishment when your program is finished and works!
