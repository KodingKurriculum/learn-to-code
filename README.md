# Learn to Code

## What does it mean to code?
When a software developer writes code, they are creating instructions for the computer to perform tasks like do math, display a webpage, or store information.  Developers use programming languages like Python or Java to write these instructions in a file.  When they run the program, a special language-specific program on the computer translates those lines of Python or Java code into something the computer understands.

## Why should I learn?
Because its valuable and fun!

## What is Python, and why use it?
Python is a multi-purpose, object-oriented programming language.  It is a great language to learn with because its syntax is comparatively understandable and concise.

In a few short lines of code, you can perform various tasks like query a database, read and create an Excel document, or pull information from a website. The Python community has created machine learning and plotting programs that even a novice could use.  Truly, the limits and benefits of using Python to do things for you are left up to your imagination and persistence.
