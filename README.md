# Python Tutorial
Python is a multi-purpose, object-oriented programming language.

## Installation
There are a few things you need to begin programming in Python. All of these things (and more) are included with the download of the application bundle Anaconda[https://www.continuum.io/downloads]. The three key ingredients of Anaconda[https://www.continuum.io/downloads] that you should be most concerned with is Python the language, Spyder the programming language, and Conda the package manager.

**Python** - The language code, base libraries, and compiler that makes up the Python language and enables you to run Python scripts.
**Spyder** - Also known as an IDE, Spyder is the program you use to actually type and run Python code.
**Conda** - The package manager used to download versions of Third-party libraries that can be used by your code.


## Beginners
Follow along the beginners path below in the beginner directory.  You will learn the anatomy of programming in Python, and perform a variety of basic tasks.

### Beginner 1 - Variables, Hello World!
Your first program. Congratulations!  In this lesson, you will learn a few basic

**comments** - Lines of code that are ignored by the program.  They are meant to convey information to the programmer what is happening in the code.
**console** -
**debugging** - The
**for loop** -


### Beginner 2 - Functions & Dictionaries

**functions** - .
**parameters** -


### Beginner 3 - Pandas &



### Beginner 4 - Import Statements & Third-party Libraries
The term "third-party library" refers to a package of code that other people have written.  One of the many benefits of writing code in Python is that it has a very large and active development community. This community has built a variety of code that performs many different functions - including scientific operations, file manipulation, and more! The import statement makes these functions available to your code.


## Additional Information
There are many resources to develop
