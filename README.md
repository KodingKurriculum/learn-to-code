# Learn to Code

## What does it mean to code?
When a software developer writes code, they are creating instructions for the computer to perform tasks like do math, display a webpage, or store information.  Developers use programming languages like Python or Java to write these instructions in a file.  When they run the program, a special language-specific program on the computer translates those lines of Python or Java code into something the computer understands.

## Why should I learn?
Learning to code is valuable and fun!
* Its valuable because you learn a new skill that can have a dramatic influence on the way that you solve problems.
* Its fun because writing code can be challenging and rewarding. You feel a sense of accomplishment when your program is finished and works!

## Lesson 1
### Welcome to the "Learn to Code" Series!
In this class, you'll learn the most basic elements of what it means to write code.  The best parts about this tutorial?

    No installation needed!
    No prior knowledge necessary!
    No major time investment!

### Lets get started.
Type the following code in the top left box, and click run
`print('Hello world!')`

### Congrats!
While being a boring program, it is your first.  You told Python to print the text 'Hello world!', and that's exactly what it did.

As you might guess, print(...) is a Python function that prints out to the screen whatever is passed in as a parameter.
