1.) Lists (also known as an Array) are great for storing a series of information.
You can iterate the list to access its contents, or specify a single value. Python
is zero-based, in that each position in the array is given a number from 0 to the
last element.

Add your name to the list

2.) Dictionaries are even more useful in that they can store key/value pairs of
information. As you may notice, the dictionary below looks a lot like an Excel
header with a list of values below.
